## Module Project: Inference for Linear Regression
### Learning Objectives
- Identify the appropriate hypotheses to test for a statistically significant relationship between two quantitative variables.
- Conduct and interpret a t-test for the slope parameter.
- Identify the appropriate parts of the output of a linear regression model and use them to build a confidence interval for the slope term.
- Make the connection between the t-test for a population mean and a t-test for a slope coefficient.
- Identify violations of the assumptions for linear regression
